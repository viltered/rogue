# rogue
Prototype old-school [roguelike](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Main_Page) arena game. The player (@) can move diagonally using num pad or cast spells with Q, S, D and F. Killed enemies have a chance to drop their spell on the ground. Spells can then be picked up using A, Z, E and R. Keep collecting better spells and fighting off waves to get a high score.
